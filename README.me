# Rwandan Community in Arizona — Website

A luxury, responsive, multi-page static site. Replace placeholder text, dates, and sample images with real content.

## Files
- `index.html` — Home with responsive slider
- `about.html` — Mission, values, history, leadership
- `events.html` — Upcoming & annual events
- `resources.html` — Community resources & sample directory
- `news.html` — News & updates
- `contact.html` — Contact form, membership, volunteer, sponsorship
- `styles.css` — Theme & layout
- `script.js` — Slider, mobile nav, on-scroll reveal
- `assets/logo.svg`, `assets/favicon.svg`

## Customize
- Swap texts directly in each HTML file.
- Update images by changing the `background-image:` URLs or `<img>` `src` attributes.
- Colors are defined in `:root` CSS variables (Rwanda blue/yellow/green + Arizona sunset).

## Run
Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step required.

## Notes
- The contact form uses a demo handler (JavaScript alert). Connect it to your email or a service (Formspree, etc.).
- Replace placeholder names, dates, and phone numbers.
